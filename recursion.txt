1. What is recursion?
Ans: Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on the solutions of small instances of the same problem.
Recursion is when a function calls itself.

2. Why is recursion important?
Ans: Recursion breaks a big problem into the smaller versions of the same problem which is helpful to solve the problem.

3. Points to keep in mind:
i. We must need a base condition that breaks the recursion, otherwise the loop will go forever and will crash the program.
